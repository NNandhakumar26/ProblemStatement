A library consists of books with unique ID's ranging from 1-1000, Due to corona pandemic a robotic arm is used to search, pick and handover the books from shelves in the library (with respect to BookID). The robot functions in accordance to the Binary searching algorithm and hence the delay time increases with respect to the number of comparisons made. Hence the robot has to display a delay message if the Book Id takes more time to be searched and brought back, while using a binary search tree algorithm. If the number of comparisons made is less than 5, then display the message" Collect the book from counter" else if the number of comparisons is equal to or greater than 5, Then the robot should send a message "Searching and grabbing of book will take some time, Please wait"
